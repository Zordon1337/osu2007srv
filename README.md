## osu backend emulator for version before bancho came out(b70-b222)

### notes
<pre>
  this server is just proof-on-concept
  i don't gurantee it will be stable

  server on first login attempt gonna create db tables, and insert default
  beatmap(disco prince) to beatmap checksum whitelist

  server DOES NOT include irc chat, you have to make one yourself 
  or use my <a href="https://github.com/Zordon1337/EIRC">very basic server</a>
